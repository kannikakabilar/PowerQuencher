# Power Quencher
Power Quencher is a Java application, a personal project that I had worked on, which provides customers to make selections of their order and simultaneously view their receipt. The application is a form of virtual menu for companies to present their service and products online.
## How to run the program
The application can be run using this jar file on most machines running Java:
[PowerDrink.jar](https://github.com/kannikakabilar/PowerQuencher/blob/main/PowerDrink.jar)
